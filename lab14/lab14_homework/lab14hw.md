Answer the following questions in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.



## Questions

1. Look up 'Data Scientist' at https://www.bls.gov/. What degree is required for this career? Is it a growing occupation? 

Only an entry-level bachelor's degree is required. This is a very fast growing occupation. It is predicted to grow more than 30% between 2021 and 2031, which is 6 times faster than average careers.


2. How would you describe your data science skills on a resume for a job application? Write a blurb that reflects the skills you have learned in this course. 

Able to contribute a broad range of data science skills for use independently and collaboratively,including proficiency in data analysis, data visualization, quantitative analysis, and modelling.


3. What are your current career interests, and how could your R skills support that career path? (hint: this might be good content for your LinkedIn profile ;)

My current career interest is chiefly infectious disease epidemiology and the application of modelling this for improving the understanding of disease transmission and evaluating the effectiveness of disease control policy.


4. What about this course has been the most difficult for you? What has been the most rewarding?

Nothing has been particularly difficult - the course was incredibly well-organised. The most rewarding has been seeing my coding skills improve consistently every week and now having the confidence to approach any dataset for analysis.


5. What do you wish you had known, or what skills do you wish you had, before taking this class.

I do not think any skills were required prior to the class, which was very nice.


6. If we had 1 more lab in this class, what would you have liked to learn more about?

I would have love to learn more about mapping.

7. Now that you have (almost!) completed this course, do you plan to pursue further data or computer science skills? What do you plan to do?

Definitely! I would like to learn how to use R for Bayesian statistical analyses mathematical modeling, and GIS applications. I would also like ot take a Python class.

8. How important was working with a partner to your success in this class? If this class were transitioned to an online format, how do you think that would affect your understanding?

Talking with others was useful to find code errors or to compare approaches, but during the tests, it was very distracting and noisy. Maybe it would be better to limit discussion time to the last 30 minutes.

I would not want to take this course online, because the help that Hannah and Joel provided when I got stuck was invaluable. It also helped to focus and stay on track by being forced to be present in the lectures. I think online it would be too easy to be distracted with other things and fall behind/ miss crucial steps and become frustrated.

9. Did you complete the class evaluation? Please complete the class evaluation using the link provided in the announcements. Your feedback is very important and we appreciate your time.
