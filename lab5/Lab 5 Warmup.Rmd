1. Load the bison data.

```{r}
bison <- readr::read_csv("data/bison.csv")
```

2. What are the dimesions and structure of the data?
```{r}
dim(bison)
```


3. We are only interested in code, sex, weight, year of birth. Restrict the data to these variables and store the dataframe as a new object.
```{r}
names(bison)
```
```{r}
bison2 <- data.frame(select(bison, "animal_code", "animal_sex", "animal_weight", "animal_yob"))
```

4. Pull out the animals born between 1980-1990.
```{r}
filter(bison, animal_yob == 1980:1990)
```

5. How many male and female bison are represented between 1980-1990?
```{r}
bison3 <- filter(bison, animal_yob == 1980:1990)
table(bison3$animal_sex)
```

6. Between 1980-1990, were males or females larger on average?
```{r}

```
